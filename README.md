Since you are building this for a high-profile figure like **DJ Cuppy**, the README should reflect the same "Luxury meets Afrobeats" energy of the website itself. This is also a perfect opportunity to showcase your **Technical Authority** by making the documentation as professional as the code.

Here is a structured `README.md` template for your GitHub repository.
